      <h2>Business Funding</h2>
      <p>A merchant cash advance provider gives you an upfront sum of cash in exchange for a slice of your future sales. ...
        Instead of making one fixed payment every month from a bank account over a set repayment period, with a merchant
        cash advance you make daily or weekly payments, plus fees, until the advance is paid in full. In most cases our clients
        receive funding in there bank accounts within 72 hours</p>
      <p>A hard money loan is simply a short-term loan secured by real estate. They are funded by private investors (or a fund
        of investors) as opposed to conventional lenders such as banks or credit unions. The terms are usually around 12
        months, but the loan term can be extended to longer terms of 2-5 years.</p>
      <p>Most factoring companies purchase invoices in two installments. The first installment – the factoring advance – covers
        about 80% of the receivable (this amount varies). The remaining 20%, less the factoring fee, is rebated as soon as
        your client pays the invoice in full . In most cases our clients receive funding in there bank accounts within 72
        hours.

                    <h2>Business Funding</h2>
                    <p>A merchant cash advance provider gives you an upfront sum of cash in exchange for a slice of your future
                        sales. ... Instead of making one fixed payment every month from a bank account over a set repayment
                        period, with a merchant cash advance you make daily or weekly payments, plus fees, until the advance
                        is paid in full. In most cases our clients receive funding in there bank accounts within 72 hours
                        </p>
                    <p>A hard money loan is simply a short-term loan secured by real estate. They are funded by private investors
                        (or a fund of investors) as opposed to conventional lenders such as banks or credit unions. The terms
                        are usually around 12 months, but the loan term can be extended to longer terms of 2-5 years.</p>
                    <p>Most factoring companies purchase invoices in two installments. The first installment – the factoring
                        advance – covers about 80% of the receivable (this amount varies). The remaining 20%, less the factoring
                        fee, is rebated as soon as your client pays the invoice in full . In most cases our clients receive
                        funding in there bank accounts within 72 hours.</p>
